## User Story (rough)

As a user I am looking for a resource that will allow me to view and purchase listings from other users, as well as create my own listing where I can sell or trade my item for another item. 

When I load into the application, I am presented with a screen displaying listings from other users, and I am able to create an account or login if I already have one. After logging in, I am able to navigate to the sell page where I can create my own listing and add a price and/or add an item I am seeking in trade for my item.
